# Part 1

## recap

- Convex
- Strong duality: generic algorithm (interior point method)
- Weak duality: non-convex opt.- Lagrangian relaxation

## Machine learning

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
  - Learn something about data
  - 실제 data의 prob. 를 학습하여, synthesize data를 만듬: Generative model
  - 
- Why GAN?
  - GAN을 solving opt. problem으로 complement 가능
  - Strong duality plays a crucial role in the context

## Today

- Generative model과 opt. 간의 관계를 면밀히 조사함
  - 여러 generative model methodology 중에 하나에 집중함
  - 이유: 최근 breakthrough led to particular yet very powerful methodology
  - Formulate opt. problem for generative model
  - Discuss how the opt. leads to to be focused methodology

# Part 2

## GAN

- generating fake data so that it exhibits a similar distri. as that of real data

- A recent breakthrough

- Powerful generative model : Ian Goodfellow (2014) - GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

  - very realistic fake samples

- One variant GAN

  - Leon Bottou (2017) : Wasserstein GAN
  - Why WGAN?
    - Wasserstein distance
    - Strong duality

# Part 3

## Optimization for generative modeling
